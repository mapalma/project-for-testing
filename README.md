# ProjectForTesting

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.19.

## Purpose
    This project serves as a playground to explore and practice:

    - New features introduced in Angular 18+
    - Reactive programming with RxJS
    - Unit testing with Jasmine and Karma
    - Best practices for accessibility using Reactive Forms

## Technologies Used

- **Angular 18** (with standalone components)
- **RxJS 7**
- **Jasmine** & **Karma** for unit testing
- **SCSS** for styling
- **Google Fonts**: [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)
- **Font Awesome** for icons

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
